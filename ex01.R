## Enter these commands *at the CONSOLE*

3 * 7

4 ^ 4

## Order of operations

3 + 5 ^ 2

(3 + 5) ^ 2

## Constants

pi

## Save results of expressions to objects

x = 2 * 7

y = 3 + 4

x

y

x + y

x + y ^ 2

z = x + y ^ 2

z

z = 32

z

z = z ^ 2

z

## Look what happens when you enter an incomplete expression:

z = 5 + 

## To get back to the ">", either finish your expression and enter, or
## press escape multiple times
  
## Comparison operators

x > 5

x < 14 

x <= 14 

x > y

x >= y * 2

x = y   ## oh no, we just redefined x !!!!

x = 14

x == y

x == y * 2

## Naming objects - not limited to just single letters

x1 = 22

## Camel case / Upper-lower case  

ShoeSize = 14

## Snake case

shoe_size = 12

shoe_size

SHOE_SIZE

## This won't work:

shoe-size = 9.5

## But this is ok

shoe.size = 9.5

## Objects can store character values also (aka string)

shoe_color = "brown"

shoe_color

## What happens if you add a string to a number? 

shoe_color + shoe_size

## Challenge. Write an expression that returns the area of a circle whose diameter is 10m

## HINT: area = pi times radius squared

## Answer

pi * (10 / 2) ^ 2

## ans 78.54

## Data Types

## All R objects have a class / type
## You can view the class with:

class(shoe_color)

class(shoe_size)

## Teaser

hist(rnorm(1000))
